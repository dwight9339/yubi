Yubi is a Shopify app for merchants who sell one-of-a-kind, custom, often hand-crafted products. Selling these types of products poses a unique problem because you need to create a new product listing for each item and delete this listing after the item sells. This can cause a lot of unnecessary work because often these items are similar enough to share almost the same product description and deleting them afterwards causes dead links which can be harmful to a store's SEO.

Yubi provides a way to quickly list unique products as variants of a parent product. The parent product contains a generic description for the group of unique products and the variants have a description metafield attached so merchants can add a unique description for that particular item. Yubi also includes theme app blocks for displaying variant description and name data and even a custom thumbnail variant picker.
