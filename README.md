Yubi is a Shopify app designed specifically for merchants who sell one-of-a-kind, custom, often hand-crafted products. It simplifies the process of creating and managing individual listings for similar yet unique items, helping to preserve the store's SEO by preventing dead links.

## How it Works

Yubi allows merchants to list unique products as variants of a parent product. The parent product contains a generic description for the group of unique products, while variants have a description metafield attached for a unique description for that particular item. Yubi also includes theme app blocks for displaying variant description, name data, and a custom thumbnail variant picker.
